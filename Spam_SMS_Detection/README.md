# Spam SMS Detection

This is **TASK 4** of my Machine Learning Internship at **CODSOFT**

# Objective
Build a model that can classify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** using text preprocessing, TF-IDF, and Naive Bayes.

# Dataset
- `spam.csv`: Contains messages labeled as `spam` or `ham`.

# Techniques Used
- Data Cleaning
- Label Encoding
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Naive Bayes Classifier

# Model Accuracy
Achieved ~XX% accuracy *(update with your result)*
