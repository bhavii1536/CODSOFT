# Customer Churn Prediction
This is **TASK 3** of my Machine Learning Internship at **CODSOFT**

# Objective  
Develop a model to predict customer churn using historical data including demographics, account info, and usage behavior.

# Dataset  
Churn_Modelling.csv – Contains information about bank customers and whether they exited.

# Techniques Used  
- Data Cleaning  
- Label Encoding for categorical variables  
- Feature Scaling using StandardScaler  
- Random Forest Classifier for prediction

# Model Accuracy  
Achieved ~86% accuracy (depends on your output)
